0,1,You wake up to the sound of alarms. Not unusual for this bucket of bolts of a spacecraft. Taking a quick look at your terminal there seems to be a hull breach. O2 levels are remaining constant so it's probably just a malfunctioning sensor.  After checking the time you realise you still have three hours until your shift starts.,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,2,Check on the alarms.;Go back to sleep.;;;,2,3,-1,-1,-1
2,1,You go to meet with the engineering head Phil. When you ask about the alarm he tells you that something scraped against the hull a while ago and took out most of the exterior sensors. He procedes to ask you to check on the Attitude Determination and Control System. ,4,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,1,It doesn’t take you very long to fall back asleep. You have learned to tune out some impressively loud disruptions. It was necessary to be able to live on this ship.,10,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,1,You reach the command deck and are surprised to find that the ADCS is functioning properly. Its strange that the ship collided with something considering the preset course was being followed. Its urgent that you report your findings to Phil. He will most likely be on the main deck. It's where most of the crew gathers during the day.,5,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,1,As you head to the main deck you hear the distinct sound of laser fire and the equaly distinct sound of the captain's flintlock pistol. Rounding the corner you see ten of the crew behind a hastily constructed baracade shooting into the dark corridor. As soon as Nate sees you he yanks you behind cover and yells somehing about what a feather-brained orangitan you are. You try to ask what is happening when the door next to you suddenly opens leaving you inches from the pincers of some monstrous creature.,6,-1,-1,-1,-1
6,3,1,7,8,-1,-1,-1
7,1,"As you finish off your foe the captain orders everyone to fall back and seal the bulk head. As the last crew member made it through Nate shouts ""what the hell are those things?!"" The captain respons ""Matey there be tales since ancient times of monsters from the deep and we be sailing in the deepest waters man's ever sailed in."" ""Cap'n we don't wanna hear your stupid sailing stories those were aliens what are we gonna do?"" The captain replies ""we do what we always do. Fight to the last man and come out on top. First we re-claim the bridge then we restore the the engines and finally we'll detach and blow these monsters to smithereens.""",9,-1,-1,-1,-1
9,2,Go with the bridge team.;Go with the engine team.;Go back to Phil.;Track down Arda.;;;,11,12,13,14,-1
10,1,Nate wakes you up and starts yelling about some sort of praying mantis. You soon realise that he's not joking and the ship has been invade by some sort of bug like alien and you're being volunteered to go reclaim the engine room. ,12,-1,-1,-1,-1
11,1,You and the crew rush to the bridge. There are reports coming in that there are large quantities of these creatures gathering at this location. You manage to fight your way through the couple of aliens that stand between you and the bridge. When you reach your destination you are met with more creatures than you can count. Luckily you are accompanied by the near full strength of your crew. Both sides charge and clash in combat. You stand ready to battle the two creatures standing before you.,36,-1,-1,-1,-1
12,1,There are reports that the aliens are gathering in the engine room. The theory is that they are attracted to the heat that the engines put out. If they take out the ships engines you are a sitting duck and there is no chance of survival. You manage to fight your way through the couple of aliens that stand between you and the engine room. When you reach your destination you are met with more creatures than you can count. Luckily you are accompanied by the near full strength of your crew. Both sides charge and clash in combat. You stand ready to battle the two creatures standing before you.,36,-1,-1,-1,-1
36,3,2,37,8,-1,-1,-1
37,1,The aliens are no match for you. You hastily defeat your adversaries and your shipmates appear to be doing the same. Seeing that they clearly will not be winning this fight the last few aliens make their leave. This was not the first time you had to fend off invaders and it most likely would not be the last.,38,-1,-1,-1,-1
13,1,Phil is thrilled when you return with data from the ADCS. He is finally able to close a few issues in the GitHub repository. You are rewarded with a few points on the spreadsheet. You are now slightly closer to having your name engraved on CougSat 1.,38,-1,-1,-1,-1
14,1,"I-uh I-I'll find Arda sir!"""" you stammer out. You make a one-eighty and race down the hallway toward the belly of the ship. Arda has got to know what to do against these things if not him then who? The whole ship seemed to be infested with them and nobody had any idea what they were. You rush down a stairway and are about to turn the corner to the equipment room when you hear eerily familiar sounds.""",15,-1,-1,-1,-1
15,2,Stay and listen more.;Round the corner.;;;,16,17,-1,-1,-1
16,1,You hide behind the corner and listen closely. There's some sort of language and a deep mutter you can't understand at all. After a bit more waiting you don't hear the creatures anymore and decide to approach. A man is splayed across the wall limbs and blood smeared everywhere. You see a face and get closer to see who it is. Arda. You back away frightened by the sight and race for the captain as fast as you can.,19,-1,-1,-1,-1
17,1,"You race into the next hallway to see a wide-eyed Arda as two of the beasts scurry away to your sudden appearance. You approach the man but you quickly realize something is wrong. His expression isn't changing almost like its frozen. He's muttering something so you get close and crouch down. ""Arda?"" you ask him. He doesn't change he just keeps muttering the same thing over and over but you can't understand it. Its not the common tongue. Something is very very wrong.",18,-1,-1,-1,-1
18,2,Run back to the captain.; Try to help Arda.;;;,19,35,-1,-1,-1
35,1,"You are disgusted as you hear Arda's murmuring slowly turn to gurgles. It sounds as if his neck is full of fluids about to burst. You watch as his neck begins to swell and his head begins to lean back. You hear a ""pop"" as your face is covered with a slimy green substance. You are deafened by the shriek that led to a crushing feeling as mandibles gripped your head. You lose conciousness as the madibles begin to squeeze.",38,-1,-1,-1,-1
19,1,As you run through the hallways of the ship you run past hallways branching off into directions other than where you are headed. Down them you can hear the echoes of voices all muttering in the same matter as Arda. Chills run down your spine as you worry if the captain has been met with a similar fate. You begin to run faster as the thought of being the only survivor buries deeper into your mind.,20,-1,-1,-1,-1
20,1,You reach the room where you last saw the captain and the bulkhead has been ripped open. It sounds quiet aside from the muffled cries of pain from what sounds like the captain. The claw marks in the now mangled door are definitely those of the creatures from before.,21,-1,-1,-1,-1
21,2,Enter the room. I must reach the captain.; I'm not useful if I'm dead. I should play it safe and look for others.;;;,22,31,-1,-1,-1
22,1,"To your great relief you find the room void of those monsters. In the corner with a jagged piece of metal protruding from his chest you find the captain. As you rush to his side he recognizes it's you. ""It looks like this is where my story ends"" he says with no fear in his voice. If anything there is greatfulness in his tone. The captain wanted anything but to die of old age. ""You'll make it out of this!"" you exclaim as you try to lift him off the floor. He makes no attempt to get up. It's obvious what his means. A captain rarely wishes to meet a fate different to that of his crew. ",23,-1,-1,-1,-1
23,1,"The captain turns to you. ""The ships fuel storage has a heating mechanism in order to keep the fuel from freezing under space's extreme temperatures. If you can reach it and turn it to full blast its possible that the fuel would ignite. We may be going down but at least none of these creatures will leave this place alive."" The captain reaches into his jacket and pulls out a flask. ""However I don't expect of my crew what I can't do myself. If you wish to join me in easing the pain you are welcome to.""",24,-1,-1,-1,-1
24,2,I'm going to make these monsters suffer for what they've done.;I've had enough of this nightmare. I wish to rest.;;;,25,26,-1,-1,-1
25,1,Your rage is stronger than any amount of alcohol can quench. If you are dying today you will not be the only one. You rush out of the room towards the fuel cells. The captain behind you cracks a smile. He feels as if he can die peacefully knowing that you have everything under control.,27,-1,-1,-1,-1
26,1,You take your place next to the captain. He hands you his flask and you take a big swig. There isn't much but hopefully it will be enough to make your imminent death as painless as possible.,38,-1,-1,-1,-1
27,3,1,28,8,-1,-1,-1
28,1,As you get closer to the engine room. You begin to hear loud thumps coming from down the hall. It sounds as if something big. VERY big. Awaits you at the end. You have gone through too much to stop now. You welcome whatever comes next. As you enter the boiler room you see the largest creature yet. It is twice the size of all that you have seen before. It must have been attracted to the heat. The creature lets out a blood-curdling screech as it notices you.,29,-1,-1,-1,-1
29,3,3,30,8,-1,-1,-1
30,1,Filled with adrenhaline from slaying the beast it didn't seem as hard as you had predicted to turn the nob to max. The few seconds that passed seemed like hours but eventually you were met with a blinding light.,38,-1,-1,-1,-1
31,1,You decide against charging into the obvious death trap. You remember that the captain had ordered the crew to retake the bridge. That must be where the rest of the crew is. You begin your journey.,32,-1,-1,-1,-1
32,1,Your route to the bridge was fairly uncontested. An occasional shriek was heard coming down a hall but you came across no creatures. You aren't sure if you were lucky. However you fear the creatures are occupied elsewhere. When you burst through the bridge's doors. There is a gorey scene to behold. Four of your crew members stand in front of you shooting at a horde of five of the alien abominations. Of the countless bodies painted in red between your crew and the aliens all but a few are human. As the enemy only nears you and your allies prepare to make your final stand.,33,-1,-1,-1,-1
33,3,2,34,8,-1,-1,-1
34,1,Having one the battle you and your crew feel envigorated. The aliens were not expecting such a rapid decrease in their numbers. Seeing the threat that you pose to them the remaining creatures flee from the room. Not long after the sirens begin to stop. While you have stopped the attack the captain is no where in sight and the ship has taken a great amount of damage. You and the crew begin to take the steps towards recovery.,38,-1,-1,-1,-1
38,1,THE END! Thank you for playing,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
8,1,You Have Died,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
